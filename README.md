This repository will be used to develop a **custom GitHub Action** that sends notifications to a Slack channel whenever a Pull Request is opened, closed, approved, or rejected.

## 📌 Project Status
🚧 Work in progress – first version not implemented yet.

## 🎯 Goals
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow triggered on Pull Request events.

package.json # Project dependencies
README.md # Documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Initialize repository with base setup.
2. Create folder structure and placeholder files.
3. Implement workflow in `action.yml`.
4. Develop Slack integration script.
5. Test notifications with sample Pull Requests.
